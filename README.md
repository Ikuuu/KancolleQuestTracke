.exe should be built already. KancolleQuestTracker/bin/Debug should have it. If you dont want to simply run a .exe file feel free to rebuild it using Visual Studio, all of the code for it is in there along with the solution file.

KancolleQuestTracker/bin/Debug/InputFiles has the files needed for your quest tracking DO NOT DELETE THOSE FILES IT WILL BREAK THE APP. Instead just delete whatever contents are in there, those are my quests.

Simply go in and clear the files and input your available quests into the Quests.txt file. Add them in similarly to how they are now. (Ex. "A1,A2,A3...") the manual quests are for better tracking so just simply delete everything in there. NOTE: MAKE SURE THE QUESTS ARE IN ONE SINGLE LINE IN THE TXT FILE DO NOT ENTER AT THE END.
